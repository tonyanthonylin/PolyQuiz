Explain what inheritance is.
inheritance is to heve a a class that's made of other classes (subclasses) it makes the main class clean and organized 
and it can be very easy to edit it's subclass.

Explain what polymorphism is.
polymorphism allows us to reference a diferent part of code in a different file. because a long code takes a long time 
to compile and sometomes we don't really want to compile all the code together, in this case, we can use polymorphism 
to reference diferent code together and edit codes seperately in stead of viewing them as a whole.
